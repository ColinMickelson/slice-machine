# Slice Machine

Slice Machine is a tool that helps you build and maintain page sections, define their model, edit properties, deploy them, and much more! It also comes with a visual interface, Prismic, that allows even your most technically challenged colleagues to easily build pages without any further help from the dev team.

As of today, Slice Machine works with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) but support for other technologies is coming soon!

You can learn more about Slice Machine itself at **[slicemachine.dev](https://slicemachine.dev/)**.

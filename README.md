As a developer tool, the main goal of Slice Machine is to perfect the process of working with a CMS while developing components locally.

### 1. Build reusable website sections
We call them Slices. Create and iterate on your Slices within your codebase, without going back and forth to a web app.

It takes a few seconds to generate components with corresponding data models. Everything is stored and versioned right inside your code.

### 2. Preview your components locally
While you build your components, you'll need to preview them. Slice Machine generates updated mocks to display content in the context of your app â€” without querying any remote content.

If you already use Storybook, Slice Machine generates stories for each of your Slices.

### 3. Ship your library to a page builder
Once you're done creating your components locally, publish them to Prismic. You get a full-fledged online content editor, tailored to your components' data models. Content editors can preview Slices from there and create pages without any help!

## Installation
We're reworking our setup process with a unified command. In the meantime, you can start from a theme, available from the docs, or install Slicemachine manually in an existing project.

### New to Prismic?
You're better off starting from [the official Prismic documentation][prismic-docs]. It will teach you the concepts you need (slices and custom types) before starting. Next and Nuxt boilerplate projects are available.

### Manual installation
The following steps assume that you already have a project setup with a framework.

Although most of Slicemachine is framework agnostic, the code it generates might expect additional dependencies that will need to be installed. We'll describe those for both Next and Nuxt.

#### Install the plugin

```bash
# From inside your project
npm i --save-dev slice-machine-ui
```
The command should add a `slicemachine` script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "slicemachine": "start-slicemachine --port 9999"
}
```
npm 7 users: you might have to do this step manually.
#### Install required deps

```bash
# using React/Next
npm i --save next-slicezone prismic-reactjs
# or using Vue/Nuxt
npm i --save vue-slicezone nuxt-sm
````

Nuxt users: you will have to add `nuxt-sm` to your `nuxt.config.js` modules section.

#### Add `sm.json` manifest
Our plugin expects a small config file to be defined at the root of your project. It should contain at least a list of libraries and a Prismic API endpoint:

```JSON
{
  "libraries": ["~/path-to-slices-lib"],
  "apiEndpoint": "https://endpoint.prismic.io/api/v2"
}
````
**Notes:**
The `~/` part of the library path means that it is local. You can have multiple libraries but _Slice names should NOT conflict across libraries_.

You can get an API endpoint by creating a project on Prismic. Make sure you have access to Prismic data models (eg. you are an admin) and that your endpoint ends with `/api/v2`.

#### Login to Prismic

At the moment, you cannot login to Prismic from the plugin.
Run this command instead from the CLI:

```bash
npx prismic login
````
This stores a small token at `~/.prismic`. You will have to type this everytime the plugin warns that you are not logged in.

#### Launch Slice Machine

You should now be ready to launch the plugin:
```bash
npm run slicemachine
````
Once the CLI  gives you information regarding your project, open the given localhost address to start working.

---

### Previewing Slices
Once you are familiar with the plugin and you created a Slice, you should notice that a folder has been created inside your slices library. It contains a component code and its Prismic data model.

You should also notice that a `.slicemachine` folder has been generated. It contains (notably) the generated mocks for each of your Slices.

Import both your component and its mock in a page to preview it:

```javascript
import { MySlice } from '../slices'
import MySliceMocks from '../.slicemachine/assets/slices/MySlice/mocks.json'

// In case of Next.js
const Page = () => (
  <div>
    <MySlice slice={MySliceMocks[0]} />
  </div>
)
````
Note that `MySliceMocks` is an array of Slice variations. You get 1 Slice mock per variation.

#### Using Storybook

Add the localhost port of your Storybook instance to `sm.json`:

```JSON
{
  "apiEndpoint": "...",
  "storybook": "http://localhost:6000"
}
````

In `.storybook/main.js`, import our `getStoriesPaths` helper and use it inside `stories` array:

```javascript
const { getStoriesPaths } = require('slice-machine-ui/helpers/storybook')

module.exports = {
  // ...,
  stories: [...getStoriesPaths()]
}
````

Run Storybook. You should now be able to access it from Slice Machine, and screenshots will be taken from there everytime you save/push your Slices.

### Publishing your library
Once you're happy with the result, it's time to publish it to Prismic. Note that if you want to be able to use a Slice in one of your pages (Custom types), you will have to click on "Add slices" in the Custom types editor and select the Slices to be used.

Pushing a Custom type to Prismic will push all the Slices that are linked to it.

Inside Prismic.io, you should now be able to create documents and use the Slices you defined locally using Slice Machine ðŸŽ‰

### Next step

Connect your pages to Prismic!

Next user? Check [this page](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/query-api-nextjs) out!
Nuxt user? Check [this page](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/query-content-from-cms-nuxtjs) instead.

If you use another technology, it's probably listed there: https://prismic.io/docs

Have fun!

### New Feature

SliceMachine now supports custom screenshots for your components.
To enable the feature, simply add a `preview.(png|jpg)` to each of your components folders.

When saving slices to file system, a screenshot will still be taken and stored in `.slicemachine/assets`.
When pushing slices to Prismic, the builder will select the screenshot by favouring the custom preview file first,
then the automatic screenshot

We added more options to RichText and fixed a bug in the validation of Image widgets.

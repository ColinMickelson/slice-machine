### New Feature

SliceMachine now supports variations! ✌️

Now, you can create different variations of a slice from the UI.
It will generate all of them in your `model.json` but it will also generate mocks and stories for you.
Thumbnails are also variation-based so you can have a generated thumbnail or a custom one for every single variation.

To customize the thumbnails, in a slice folder you need to create a folder named after the variation ID and put your
`preview.png` file.

#### Also

Previously, stories were generated in your component folder, same as mocks.
We now consider that everything that can be generated should be store in `.slicemachine` and everything stored
in a component folder should be the user property.

To take control of your mocks and stories, you simple need to add `mocks.js` and `index.stories.js` in
a component folder.
It will also prevent the builder to keep generating mocks and stories as long as you have custom ones.

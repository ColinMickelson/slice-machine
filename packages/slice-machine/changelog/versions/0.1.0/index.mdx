### We now support slice variations! ✌️

Variations allow you to create another version of your Slice in the Slice Machine and allow your content creators to choose from these different versions when using the Slice in the document editor.

Each of them comes with its own thumbnail that can be previewed in the Prismic writing room.
They also come with their own stories and their mocks can also be configured separately!

To customise the thumbnails, create a folder named after the variation ID and put your
`preview.png` file. Something like: `slices/MySlice/default-variation/preview.png`

### We now support custom types! 🎉

Yes! You can now create/update custom types from the local builder.

This should remove some back and forth between the local builder and the writing room:
mainly, you can now define which slice should be included in the custom type SliceZone.
Pushing the custom type to Prismic will also save and push all linked slices!

To customise custom types thumbnails, create a `index.png` file in each CT folder eg. `customtypes/homepage/index.png`.

If you were connected to your Prismic api endpoint when you loaded this page, your existing custom types
have been downloaded and save in your project. Check them out!

### New Design! 🖼

We rethink the SliceMachine UI/UX to make it clearer and simpler to use.

So we reshaped the tool with :

- · A more intuitive way to edit/add fields in Slices and Custom Types
- · A new navigation to switch easily between Custom Types and Slices whenever you want

We hope you will like this new interface, if you found some improvements or have suggestions don't hesitate to create to contact us.

#### Also

- · We added the (much requested) Content Relationship field
- . We added the LinkToMedia field for slices and Custom Types
- . Storybook is now optional to have a functional slicemachine
- · Libraries index files (eg. `slices/index.js`) are now regenerated after each save
- · Generated mocks and stories are now stored in `.slicemachine/assets`
- · Various fixes, a bit more stability

#### Migration

When you launched the new builder, we ran a migration over your content: all mocks and stories
have been moved to `.slicemachine/assets`. This may break the first render of Storybook. If that's the case
for you, try to manually save slices that have any issue. If your mocks & stories aren't modified between saves,
check that the files have been correctly migrated!

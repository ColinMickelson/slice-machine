### Moving away from Storybook ðŸš…

As you know, Storybook has been causing a lot of installation issues for users that weren't familiar with it. Maintaining such a dependency has been hard, both for the Prismic team creating the integration and Slice Machine users.

This is why we decide to move away from Storybook and create the <b>Slice Simulator</b>.

- It's an in-house solution with very minimal scope (whole solution weight less than 5kb gzipped).
- Unlike Storybook it relies on your framework's bundler. So there are no issues with your CSS solution, tools you use, etc.
- To make installing Slice Simulator as easy as possible we have created in-app installation steps to help you configure your project.

<br />
<b>NOTE:</b> Slice Machine will still continue to create Stories automatically
for your components if you wish to continue using Storybook.

### Full link field functionality

Now when adding a link field the content creators will have a choice of internal/external/media links.

### We improved the way you install Slice Machine dependencies

Depending on your framework, when you use the `@slicemachine/init` script we installed all the necessary dependencies to get a Prismic project up and running.

### Feedback loop

We design Slice Machine features based on your experience. That's why we have decided to implement a feedback loop within the Slice Machine to learn more about your experience at the source.
This is only a small amount of information about whether you are using the onboarding and Slice Simulator.

If you don't want to give your feedback, you can disable it by setting `tracker:false` into your `sm.json`

### Bug fixes

- Custom types must now be created with an id

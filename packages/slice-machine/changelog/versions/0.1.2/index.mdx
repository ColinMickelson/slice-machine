### Learn Slice Machine in a few slides ðŸš€

We created a page at `/onboarding` that explains the core concepts of Slice Machine. This will show up once and remain accessible anytime via the URL.

It will explain the following concepts:

- How to create a Slice
- How to use your Slices to build a page
- How to push your Slices to use them in the content editor

### A new modal to rate your experience with Slice Machine ðŸ”¢

You can rate your experience using Slice Machine and give us feedback to help us improve the product.

### You won't have to log in as much ðŸ¤˜

To avoid having to log in every day to play with Slice Machine we implemented two things :

- Your authentication tokens will now last 48 hours.
- Your token will refresh automatically

### Bug fixes

- When creating a new variation based on an existing one, the scroll in the variation list has been fixed.

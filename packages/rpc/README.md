Simple [remote procedure calls (RPC)][rpc-wiki] in TypeScript.

- ðŸ¤” &nbsp;Fully typed procedure calls using your TypeScript typesâ€”no runtime validation needed.
- ðŸ¥´ &nbsp;Handles binary data in both directions (think: file uploads and downloads).
- ðŸ™ƒ &nbsp;Compatible with any Express-like server.

## Install

```bash
npm install @slicemachine/rpc
```

## Quick start

1.  Create an RPC Express middleware containing your procedures. A procedure is any sync or async function that accept one or no arguments.

    The middleware can be used anywhere [Express middleware][express-middleware] is accepted.

    ```typescript
    // src/rpc-middleware.ts

    import { createRPCMiddleware, ExtractProcedures } from "@slicemachine/rpc";

    export const middleware = createRPCMiddleware({
    	procedures: {
    		ping: async () => {
    			await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

    			return "pong";
    		},
    	},
    });

    // This type will be passed to the RPC client.
    export type Procedures = ExtractProcedures<typeof middleware>;
    ```

2.  Add the middleware to your Express-compatible server.

    ```typescript
    // src/server.ts

    import express from "express";
    import { middleware } from "./rpc-middleware";

    const app = express();

    // Pass `middleware` from the previous step.
    app.use("/rpc", middleware);

    app.listen();
    ```

    The server is now set up to accept RPC calls at `/rpc` using a client.

3.  In your remote app (e.g. your app's frontend), create a client to call the RPC server.

    ```typescript
    // src/index.ts

    import { createRPCClient } from "@slicemachine/rpc";
    import type { Procedures } from "./rpc-middleware";

    const client = createRPCClient<Procedures>({
    	serverURL: "https://example.com/rpc",
    });

    const pong = await client.ping(); // => "pong"
    ```

    Calling `client.ping()` will send a request to the server at `https://example.com/rpc` and return `ping()`'s return value from the server. The client is fully typed using your procedure's types.

### Concepts

RPCs require two pieces: a server and a client. Procedures, a fancy name for functions, are called in the client and run on the server.

You are no longer limited to what non-server environments like browser support. File system interaction, communication with private APIs, and computationally heavy tasks can now be called directly from clients.

### Setting up procedures on the server

An HTTP server is required to use RPCs; it is the "remote" in "remote procedure calls". `@slicemachine/rpc` supports any server that accepts Express middleware, such as [Express][express], [Fastify][fastify], or [h3][h3].

Use `createRPCMiddleware()` to create an Express middleware that handles RPC requests. The middleware contains code to run your procedures as well as the TypeScript types to type your client.

The following example creates an RPC middleware with a `ping()` procedure. The procedure waits 1000 milliseconds before returning `"pong"`.

```typescript
import { createRPCMiddleware, ExtractProcedures } from "@slicemachine/rpc";

export const middleware = createRPCMiddleware({
	procedures: {
		async ping() {
			await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

			return "pong";
		},
	},
});

// This type will be passed to the RPC client.
export type Procedures = ExtractProcedures<typeof middleware>;
```

The exported `Procedures` type will be provided to the client to get full compile time type safety.

The middleware should be added to an HTTP server and served locally (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) or remotely (e.g. `https://example.com`). The middleware can live alongside other routes in the server.

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { middleware } from "./rpc-middleware";

const app = express();

// Provide the RPC middleware created using `createRPCMiddleware`.
app.use("/rpc", middleware);

app.listen();
```

Procedures can accept named arguments using an object parameter.

```typescript
export const middleware = createRPCMiddleware({
	procedures: {
		add({ a, b }: { a: number; b: number }) {
			return a + b;
		},
	},
});
```

Procedures can be sync or async.

```typescript
export const middleware = createRPCMiddleware({
	procedures: {
		async getCatFact(): Promise<string> {
			const res = await fetch("https://catfact.ninja/fact");
			const json = await res.json();

			return json.fact;
		},
		getStaticCatFact(): string {
			return "Cats are specifically not powered by flat-six, naturally aspirated, high-revving engines.";
		},
	},
});
```

Procedure return values are optional.

```typescript
export const middleware = createRPCMiddleware({
	procedures: {
		async wait({ ms }: { ms: number }): Promise<void> {
			await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
		},
	},
});
```

### Calling procedures in the client

Calling procedures requires a client library. The client serializes arguments, routes requests to the RPC server, and deserializes the server's response. It provides compile time type safety by reading your procedure's types.

```typescript
// Somewhere not on a server, such as a browser.

import type { Procedures } from "./path/to/your/server";

const client = createRPCClient<Procedures>({
	serverURL: "https://example.com/rpc",
});

const pong = await client.ping();
```

In the above example, `client.ping()` sends a request to the RPC server at `https://example.com/rpc` and returns the procedure's return value.

The RPC client serializes arguments and return values for you, providing a [mostly 1:1 API](#limitations) between your procedure types and the client.

### Limitations

- **Binary data**: On the server, binary data is handled using `Buffers`s. On the client, binary is data handled using `Blobs`. `@slicemachine/rpc` converts between both automatically.

- **Procedures can only accept up to one argument**: Procedures cannot accept more than one argument, but they can accept a single object argument with mulitple named properties.
